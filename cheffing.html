        <h2>What is cheffing?</h2>
                <p>Cheffing is an artistic expression</p>
                <p>Cheffing is an unforgiving science</p>
                <p>You must be intimitaly aware of your ingridients' finest qualities and their most finicky temperaments.</p>
                <p>It is your role as conductor to help them blossom and encourage their individual expression of their personalities, their talents, their passions.</p>
                <p>And care must be taken not to play favorites.  All the members you have so lovingly selected and cared after must get along and play nice with each other.</p>
                <p>No showboats allowed or you risk loosing the balance that is being so delicately crafted.</p>
                <p>All of this while in the midst of battling angry destructive flames who laughingly threaten to destroy your friends who helplessly look up at you through innocent misty eyes.</p>
                <p>You put them in the situation they are now in, which makes you solely responsible for their wellbeing.</p>
                <p>With fevereshness and compassion you tumble them to and fro, protecting them, bathing them, loving them.</p>
                <p>You boldly push their limits, you are taking a risk, but you know they cannot bloom if they stay bound within fear.  Nor you.</p>
                <p>That's it.  Enough!  It wasn't the timer, or a little voice.  It was you.  A feeling, a shadow, a touch.  You know they are almost there.</p>
                <p>Swiftly you remove them from the flame.  You stand back and watch them rest.</p>
                <p>You dare not disturb them.  This is their time.  They have earned it.</p>
                <p>Quietly and ceremoniously you prepare a canvas for them.  Only the best will do for their hard work.</p>
                <p>Now you present them to your guests.</p>
                <p>And like the conductor of a great symphony who with eyes closed listens to the last note as it makes it's final and dramatic solo exit, you feel pride.</p>
                <p>Both you and the conductor know that the pride you feel is not pride in yourselves, but pride in the members that blosssomed and shone.</p>
                <p>The applause at the concert hall and the ohhs and ahhs at the dining table are for them.</p>
                <p>And when it is all done.  What you have is beauty, pleasure, love.</p>
                <p>Cheffing is seduction.</p>
