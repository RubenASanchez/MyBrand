I wanted to join in but I could not understand their words.  They couldn't understand mine.</p><p>As children often did, and do.  We innovated.  We pointed, we gestured, and laughed.  We had fun.</p><p>It is this freedom and desire for open and succesful communication that I hope to disseminate and maintain in all of my endeavors.</p></section>
