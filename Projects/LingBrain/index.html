    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I developed LingBrain to serve as a centralized repository of neurolinguistic information. Much of the data comes from my personal notes and from carefully curating numerous peer reviewed journals.</p>
    <p>My research interests involve investigating the cognitive processes and the neuronal architecture involved in the perception of sound and the assignment of meaning within the context of language.</p>
    <p>I have made LingBrain freely available as a progressive web app so that anyone who wishes to can easily have access to some very exciting concepts found in cognitive science, neuroscience, psychology, and physics all in the domain of linguistics.</p>
