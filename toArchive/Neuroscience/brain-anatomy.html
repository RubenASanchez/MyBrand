                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The brain is responsible for all the cognitive tasks that the organism makes.  It is a 1 .4 kg mass of soft tissue that lives within the protective bone housing of the skull.</p>
                <p>In order to perform its cognitive tasks the brain requires vast quantities of processing power.  To provide that power there are over 80 billion neurons in the human brain.  These are arranged in a highly organized and complexly structured manner.</p>
                <p>To accommodate all these neuronal cells within the brain's volume of about 1200 cm<sup>3</sup> the surface of the brain has many folds which increase the total surface area.  These folds give the brain a wrinkled appearance.  The top of a fold is called a gyrus while a shallow crevice is called a sulcus.  A larger deeper crevice is called a fissure.</p>
                <p>What follows is a very basic and brief overview of some of the major brain structures.</p>
                <p>The brain can be classified into three main structures: the cerebrum, the cerebellum, and the brain stem.</p>

                <h1>Cerebrum</h1>

                    <section id="cerebrum-intro">
                        <h2>Intro</h2>
                        <p>The cerebrum is the largest of the three main brain structures and is located above both the cerebellum and the brain stem.  Its appearance is highly wrinkled due to the abundance of gyri, sulci, and fissures present on its surface.</p>

                                <h3>Cerebral Hemispheres</h3>
                                <p>The longitudinal fissure is the most prominent fissure on the cerebrum and it divides the cerebrum into two separate hemispheres.  The two hemispheres are contralaterally connected by the corpus callosum.  The corpus callosum consists of neural fibers bridging the gap between the two hemispheres allowing communication between them to take place.</p>

                                <h3>Cerebral Lobes</h3>
                                <p>The cerebrum can also be divided into lobes: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe.  The frontal lobe appears in the front of the cerebrum.  The parietal lobe is behind the frontal lobe.  The temporal lobe is partially below both the frontal lobe and the parietal lobe.  The occipital lobe is in the back of the cerebrum behind both the parietal lobe and the temporal lobe.</p>
                                <p>The central sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe.  The lateral sulcus separates the frontal lobe and parietal lobe from the temporal lobe.  The parieto-occipital sulcus separates the parietal lobe from the occipital lobe.</p>

                                <h3>Neuronal Composition</h3>
                                <p>The cerebrum consists of two layers: the cerebral cortex and the centrum semiovale.  The cerebral cortex makes up the outer layer and the centrum semiovale makes up the inner layer.  The cerebral cortex is comprised of grey matter.  That means it consists of neuronal cell bodies, dendrites, axons, and glial cells such as astrocytes.  Astrocytes provide nutrients and help repair injured neurons.  The centrum semiovale is comprised of white matter.  That means it consists mainly of myelinated axons and oligodendrocytes.  Oligodendrocytes form the myeling sheath around the axons.</p>

                        <h2>Cerebral Cortex</h2>
                        <p>The cerebral cortex constitutes the grey matter of the cerebrum.  It is mostly organized into six layers.  It has two main structures: the neocortex and the allocortex.  The larger neocortex consists of all six layers while the smaller allocortex consists of either three or four layers depending on the brain region.</p>

It consists of three types of tracts: association fibers, commissural fibers, and projection fibers.  Tracts are bundles of axons connecting cortical areas to other cortical areas or to deeper subcortical structures called nuclei.</p>
