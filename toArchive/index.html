                    <p>When you are at a crowded place with everyone talking loudly you are able to tune out their conversations and concentrate on the one you are having, but if someone nearby says your name, you notice it.</p>
                    <div class="paragraph-space"></div>
                    <p>This is known as the cocktail party effect.  Even though you are actively focusing on the conversation at hand and ignoring all the ones around you, passively you are still taking in all the sounds around you and at some level processing those sounds.</p>

                    <p>I am a researcher focusing in Linguistics and Neuroscience.</p>
                    <p>In particular, I am interested in the neuronal circuits involved in phonetic perception and production.  With the use of brain imaging technologies such as EEG, fMRI and MEG the dynamic nature of these networks can be captured.</p>

                    <p>Knowledge about the collaborative relationships between and amongst various brain regions can be used to improve language teaching methods, better program internet search engines, as well as help find treatments for speech pathologies.</p>

I wanted to join in but I could not understand their words.  They couldn't understand mine.</p><p>As children often did, and do.  We innovated.  We pointed, we gestured, and laughed.  We had fun.</p><p>It is this freedom and desire for open and succesful communication that I hope to disseminate and maintain in all of my endeavors.</p></section>
